#  Simple Calculator in Python

A basic command-line calculator built using Python functions.  
This project performs four arithmetic operations:

  Addition
  Subtraction
  Multiplication
  Division (with zero division handling)


##  Features

  User-friendly menu
  Function-based structure
  Input validation
  Division by zero handling
  Clean and readable code


##  Technologies Used

Python 3



##  How It Works

1. User selects an operation (1–4).
2. User enters two numbers.
3. The program calls the corresponding function.
4. The result is displayed.

##  How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator.git


2. Move into the project folder:
   cd calculator.py

   
3. Run the program:
   python calculator.py


##  Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

 Writing and calling Python functions
 Using conditional statements (if-elif-else)
 Handling user input
 Managing division by zero errors
 Structuring clean and readable code
